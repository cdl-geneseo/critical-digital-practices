## What is an operating system?

An operating system (OS) is a computer's core piece of software. The OS makes it possible for different parts of your computer to *operate* in concert. It enables other software on your computer (such as the "programs" or "applications" through which you create word-processing documents or browse the web) to interact with your computer's hardware (such as your keyboard, mouse or trackpad, display, or hard drive). It allocates the resources your computer needs to run multiple processes simultaneously. And much, much more. We'll return to operating systems when we get to the command line&mdash;the interface through which a previous generation of computer users worked with their operating systems, and which you can still use on a typical desktop or laptop computer today. Most users, however, interact with their OS through a graphical user interface (GUI), which visualizes the computer's software applications and hardware resources through windows and icons. On a computer running Microsoft's Windows OS, the GUI presents itself to you as a "File Explorer." On a computer running Apple's macOS, it presents itself as a "Finder."
