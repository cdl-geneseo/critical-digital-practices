# Defining Data

What is data? Or should that question be "What *are* data?" It's a bit of a cliché to begin discussing a complex concept by turning to Webster's, but if ever there was a case for it, this is it:

From [merriam-webster.com](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data):

> *Data* leads a life of its own quite independent of *datum*, of which it was originally the plural. It occurs in two constructions: as a plural noun (like *earnings*), taking a plural verb and plural modifiers (such as *these, many, a few*) but not cardinal numbers, and serving as a referent for plural pronouns (such as *they, them*); and as an abstract mass noun (like *information*), taking a singular verb and singular modifiers (such as *this, much, little*), and being referred to by a singular pronoun (*it*). Both constructions are standard. The plural construction is more common in print, evidently because the house style of several publishers mandates it.

Long story short: there's no right answer. In English, you'll encounter *data* sometimes as a singular (mass) noun and sometimes as a plural one. Occasionally context seems to make one or the other choice more natural. Unless you're writing for publication, it's all right to go back and forth between them.

However you construe *data* in English, it's useful to remember that, as we've just seen, in Latin it's the plural of *datum*, a "(thing) given." Thus, one way to understand data is as *things*. Perhaps because data plays such a large role in the natural and social sciences, there's a tendency to associate data with one type of thing: numbers. According to [etymonline.com](https://www.etymonline.com/word/datum#etymonline_v_29276), *data* enters the English language in the 17th century, around the time of the Western [scientific revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Revolution). From the 1890s it takes on the now familiar sense of "numerical facts collected for future reference"&mdash;perhaps (since the 1960s), in a computer *database*.

But the world is full of things that aren't numerical. These things can be data, too. Geographical locations can be treated as data. So can proper names and street addresses. So can the words in a dictionary or a poem or a novel.

## Research data

The quotations below offers a variety of perspectives on research data in particular.

> Material or information on which an argument, theory, test or hypothesis, or another research output is based.

Broadly, we can understand research data as **materials or information necessary to come to a conclusion.**  What constitutes such materials and information will depend on the project in question.

## Forms of data

Just as there are many possible sources of data, there are many ways to represent data. Here are some examples:

- Non-digital text (lab books, field notebooks)
- Digital texts or digital copies of text
- Statistical analysis (SPSS, SAS, R)
- Scientific sample collections
- Data visualizations
- Computer code
- Standard operating procedures and protocols
- Protein or genetic sequences
- Artistic products
- Curriculum materials (e.g. course syllabi)
- Spreadsheets (e.g. `.xlsx`, `.numbers`, `.csv`)
- Audio (e.g. `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.aac`)
- Video (e.g. `.mov`, `.mp4`)
- Computer Aided Design/CAD (`.cad`)
- Databases (e.g. `.sql`)
- Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial data (e.g. `.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`)
- Digital copies of images (e.g. `.png`, `.jpeg`, `.tiff`)
- Web files (e.g. `.html`, `.asp`, `.php`)
- Matlab files & 3D Models (e.g. `.stl`, `.dae`, `.3ds`)
- Metadata & Paradata (e.g. `.xml`, `.json`)
- Collection of digital objects acquired and generated during research
