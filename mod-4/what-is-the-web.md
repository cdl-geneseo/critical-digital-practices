# What is the Web?

We've [previously described the web]({{ site.url }}/mod-4/the-internet-is-not-the-web) as "a layer built on top of the internet." Let's look more closely at when and how that layer was built, and how it functions today.

## Pre-history

If the internet is a network of networked computers, we can think of the web as a network of the *information that lives on those computers*. Communication protocols link computers on the internet. What links information on the web? Well, *links*&mdash;or, as they were originally, and are sometimes still, called: [hyperlinks](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hyperlink.htm).

The concept of information linked in a decentralized network is much older than the web you access on your computer&mdash;formally known as the "World Wide Web." In print documents, for example, footnotes and bibliographical references have long served as pointers to related information sources, which, if followed, might lead to other sources, in a chain of referrals that in principle could go on indefinitely. What's distinctive, historically new, and arguably magical about the World Wide Web is its use of a software interface to let you *jump directly* from one information source to another with a simple gesture, such as a mouse-click or finger-tap.

But even the idea of linked computer documents pre-dates the web. In the 1960s, [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia" to denote linked document and media nodes, and in 1968, at a computer conference in San Francisco, Douglas Engelbart gave what has come to be known as ["The Mother of All Demos"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos) to show how his [oN-line System (NLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)) made it possible, among other things, to navigate among linked documents.

As Claire L. Evans explains in *Broad Band: The Untold Story of the Women Who Made the Internet* (Penguin, 2018):

> The most famous hypertext pioneers are men&mdash;Doug Engelbart&hellip;Ted Nelson&hellip;but the Web appeared on the scene only *after* hypertext principles and conventions had been explored for nearly a decade by brilliant female researchers and computer scientists.&hellip;Hypertext is, in many ways, the practice of transforming pure data into knowledge. And like programming a generation earlier, it was where the women were. (154-155)

In exploring why women in computing would be drawn to hypertext, Evans also illuminates how the concept helped move computing as a whole from the province of engineers, mathematicians, and scientists to the  larger domain of researchers and scholars across the natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities, and, ultimately, to the entire realm of an information-hungry general public. What the developers who worked on early hypertext systems shared "was a humanisitic, user-driven approach. To them, the final product wasn't always software: it was the *effect* software had on people" (162).
