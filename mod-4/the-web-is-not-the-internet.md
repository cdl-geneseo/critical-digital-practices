# The Web is Not the Internet

People often use the terms "internet" and "web" interchangeably. It's not hard to see why. These days, people connect to the internet primarily to access websites.

But the web is not the internet. The internet is a network of networked computers: computers able to exchange information with each other through a variety of standards and protocols, the most important of which you've already encountered: [TCP/IP](https://www.howtogeek.com/751880/the-foundation-of-the-internet-tcpip-turns-40/) (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). The web *uses* this network to make possible an ecosystem of *linked content and data*. The internet makes the web possible. Or, to put it another way, the web is a layer built on top of the internet.

## Birth of the internet

Since ballistics and code-breaking were two of the earliest applications of computing&mdash; carried out, [as we saw earlier](/critical-digital-practices/mod-1/what), by humans before they were carried out by machines&mdash; it should come as no surprise that the military played a key role in the internet's origins. In the mid-1960s, the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) developed [ARPANET](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/a/arpanet.htm). At the time, multiple users could connect via terminal to a single mainframe computer through **timesharing** to share its resources and to exchange messages and files. But as the [Computer History Museum's Marc Weber](https://computerhistory.org/blog/history-of-the-future-october-29-1969-fifty-years-of-a-connected-world/) explains, "each of those timesharing systems was a little island, an isolated community restricted to its own host computer." ARPANET represented one effort to "connect those islands to each other into archipelagos," establishing a network of interconnected computers that could talk to each other. And yet, as [Weber also explains](https://computerhistory.org/blog/who-invented-which-internet/),

> as soon as once standalone computers started getting hooked together into networks around 1970, there was a problem. Those networks couldn’t talk to each other. They were like little islands. \[Or really, to use Weber's earlier metaphor, "archipelagos."\] There was the well-known ARPANET, and also the NPL network in the UK, and soon several others, and they were all isolated. The solution was to create standards that could translate data between them and tie them into networks of networks. This process is called “internetworking” or “internetting,” and the result is called an “internet.”

More than one set of protocols was developed to enable these networks to speak to each other in a single language. Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf are credited with driving the development of TCP, [first demonstrated successfully on November 22, 1977](https://computerhistory.org/blog/born-in-a-van-happy-40th-birthday-to-the-internet/) using software written by [Virginia Strazisar](https://www.computerhope.com/people/ginny_strazisar.htm) (later Travers) to power the router (then called a "gateway") that directed the network traffic. 

By the early 1990s, TCP/IP emerged as the dominant protocol holding the world's networked computers together in a network of networks, the internet.
