# Getting Started

To get started, let's look at what Python is and how you can use it for this module.

## What is Python?

Python is a general-purpose, [high-level]([high-level](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/highll.htm)) programming language suitable for a many different tasks. It's widely used in web development, data science, and the digital humanities, and it's valued for its flexibility, readability, and comparatively concise syntax.

Originally created by [Guido van Rossum](https://www.computerhope.com/people/guido_van_rossum.htm), Python is named for the television show / comedy troupe [Monty Python's Flying Circus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus).

## How can I use Python for this module?

For this module, you'll probably do best to have a working Python installation on your machine. That said, you could carry out some of the instructions in the module using an online interpreter such as [Trinket](https://trinket.io/), or, better still, if you have a Google account, you could use [Google's Colab Notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/).

This biggest challenge you'll face for completing the module without installing Python is creating and running external scripts.

## Installing Python

Python is free to download and use. If you have a working installation of Python on your machine already, it will suffice for completing this module as long as it's a 3.x and not a 2.x version of the software. You can download Python from various sources. One is the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf-landing/). Another, **recommended for this course**, is the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com) website.

Installing Anaconda has several advantages, including the ability to launch multiple tools from Anaconda Navigator or the command line, such as [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter Notebook gives you the ability to annotate your code with explanatory text, save sessions, and export sessions in multiple formats (`.ipynb`, `.py`, `.html`, `.pdf`, for example) in order to share them with others. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) is simply Google's implementation of Jupyter Notebook.

The CUNY Graduate Center's Digital Humanities Research Institute provides an excellent [guide to Installing Anaconda](https://github.com/DHRI-Curriculum/install/blob/v2.0/guides/python.md).
