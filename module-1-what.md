# What is a computer?

Hint: it's not just a desktop or a laptop.

## Information Processing

While we won't go into the physical mechanisms of a computer (or, hardware)---you can get more info on that at a site like [ExplainThatStuff](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howcomputerswork.html)---I do want to demystify the basic information processing that makes *all* computational devices have in common.

Consider the graphic above. Do you think of all of these when you think "computer"? You should! 

All of these examples can be considered computers, because they all share one key function: they are **information processors**. Information processors work by taking in information (**input**), storing it (**memory**), working through it (**processing**), and producing results based on that input (**output**). Information is initially communicated to your computer through an interface like a mouse, a keyboard, a touchscreen, or a microphone. That information is then stored on a hard drive or, for smaller devices, a flash drive. Almost simultaneously, the information is either processed by a device's central processing unit (CPU) if it is a desktop/laptop/etc., or by a cloud server via the internet if it is a smart device like an Alexa. Finally, the processed information is returned as output via a screen, speaker, and so on.

This is just a basic outline of how computers work, but, overall, an important concept to understand in order to use your devices effectively and with context. While computers are incredibly complex instruments, this line of communication will be true for almost any "smart" device you'll encounter.

And these are just *some* examples. What else, based on this communication process, do you think could be considered a computer? What other machines do you, effectively, "talk to" and get a response from?

### Beyond the machine

Now that we've covered the fact that computers are not simply the laptops and monitors but extend to many other types of machines, this might be a good time to point out something that you might have already guessed... computers aren't *just* machines!

In fact, the earliest computers *weren't* the giant machines you've heard about, like in the image below...


... but actually came far before them, in the form of *people*.

You've just read about how computers are, essentially, information processors. Information processing is an operation that humans have always done, albeit on a vastly smaller scale than what computers are capable of doing. Imagine the process outlined earlier---input, storage and processing, and output---but done by a human. What would that look like?

Say there's a student on campus who's really good at math, and wants to make some extra cash by "helping" her classmates with some math problems (never for graded assignments or exams, *naturally... *there are just lots of students who will pay good money for the answers to some casual math equations, right? Right.). Well, business is booming, and the student is getting absolutely bombarded with math-obsessed peers dropping off pages of math equations for her to solve. She keeps a basket outside of her dorm room for students to deliver equations on paper (input), which she then takes inside of her room and places on her desk until she's ready to solve them (storage), solves them (processing), and then returns them to a separate basket outside of her door marked for pickup by paying students (output). 

Nowadays, it's unlikely that this student would have much business because computers have advanced to the point where there are many services available to do complex mathematical equations quickly and for free. People like this student were, understandably, a lot more sought-after prior to the normalization of personal computers. But it's these people who got us to where we are today, enabling us to harness their innate mathematical abilities and more with the click of a button, the stroke of a key, or the sound of our voice.
