# Prefatory Pro Tips

Before you get started, a few tips.

First, go slow at first and check your spelling! One of the biggest things you can do to make sure your code runs correctly and you can use the command line successfully is to make sure you check your spelling! _Keep this in mind!_ If at first something doesn't work, check your spelling! Unlike in human reading, where letters operate simultaneously as atomistic symbols and as complex contingencies (check [Johanna Drucker](https://genius.com/Johanna-drucker-from-a-to-screen-annotated) on the alphabet), in coding, each character has a discrete function including (especially!) spaces.

Second, keep in mind that the command line and file systems on macOS and Unix are usually pre-configured as cAsE-pReSeRvInGâ€”so capitalizations also matter when typing commands and file and folder names.

Third, while copying and pasting from this handy tutorial may be tempting to avoid spelling errors and other things, we encourage you not to! Typing out each command will help you remember them and how they work.

Now, we are ready to get started.
